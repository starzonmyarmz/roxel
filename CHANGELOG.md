# Changelog

All notable changes to Roxel are recorded here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Add bullets under `## [Unreleased]` as you land work. When a `v*` tag is
pushed, `.github/workflows/release.yml` renames the section to the new
version + date, regenerates the bullets from the tag's commit range,
commits the result back to `main`, and uses the same body for the GitHub
Release notes.
